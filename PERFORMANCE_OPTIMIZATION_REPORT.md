# Mobile Performance Optimization Report

## Overview
This report outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve mobile performance for the White Wings Visa website without changing UI or functionality.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Resource Loading Optimizations
- **Resource Hints**: Added preconnect hints for external domains to establish early connections
- **Critical CSS Handling**: Prioritized critical CSS and deferred non-critical stylesheets
- **Script Loading**: Optimized script loading with async/defer attributes for non-critical scripts
- **Font Loading**: Implemented font-display:swap for text visibility during font loading

### 2. Image Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Added lazy loading to all images to defer offscreen images
- **Responsive Images**: Implemented srcset for different screen sizes to reduce bandwidth usage
- **Image Prioritization**: Prioritized visible images based on viewport position
- **WebP Format**: Leveraged existing WebP images for better compression

### 3. Animation & Rendering Optimizations
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Applied will-change and transform:translateZ(0) to animated elements
- **Animation Timing**: Adjusted animation durations on mobile for better performance
- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified animations on mobile devices
- **Paint Optimization**: Reduced paint operations with backface-visibility and other properties

### 4. Caching & Storage Optimizations
- **Browser Cache**: Implemented local storage caching for frequently used assets
- **Cache Versioning**: Added cache versioning system to manage cached resources
- **Resource Prioritization**: Prioritized caching of critical resources

### 5. Third-Party Resource Optimizations
- **Script Deferral**: Deferred loading of non-critical third-party scripts
- **CSS Optimization**: Loaded non-critical CSS asynchronously
- **Connection Optimization**: Preconnected to third-party domains

### 6. Event Handling Optimizations
- **Passive Event Listeners**: Used passive event listeners for touch and scroll events
- **Event Debouncing**: Implemented debouncing for scroll and resize events
- **Touch Optimization**: Added touch-action:manipulation to improve touch response
