# White Wings Visa Consultancy Website Optimization Guide

This guide explains how to use the optimization tools added to the website to improve performance.

## Automatic Optimizations

The following optimizations are automatically applied to all pages:

### 1. CSS Optimization

The `css-optimizer.js` script automatically optimizes CSS loading by:
- Prioritizing critical CSS files
- Deferring non-critical CSS loading
- Adding preload for important stylesheets

### 2. Image Optimization

The `image-optimizer.js` script automatically optimizes images by:
- Adding lazy loading to images below the fold
- Setting proper loading priorities for critical images
- Adding async decoding attributes

### 3. HTML Optimization

The `html-optimizer.js` script automatically optimizes HTML by:
- Adding width and height attributes to images to prevent layout shifts
- Optimizing external script loading with defer attributes
- Adding preconnect for external domains

### 4. Master Performance Optimizer

The `performance-optimizer.js` script coordinates all optimizations and adds:
- DNS prefetching for external domains
- Font display optimization for Google Fonts
- Preloading of critical resources

## Manual Optimization Tools

For more advanced optimizations, you can use the following tools:

### CSS Minification

To minify all CSS files:

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install clean-css
   ```

2. Run the CSS minifier:
   ```
   node css-minifier.js
   ```

This will create minified versions of all CSS files with the `.min.css` extension.

### Image Optimization CLI

To optimize all images and create WebP and AVIF versions:

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install sharp
   ```

2. Run the image optimizer:
   ```
   node image-optimizer-cli.js
   ```

This will create optimized versions of all images in the `images-optimized` directory.

## Implementation Notes

- The optimization scripts are added to all HTML pages via the `performance-optimizer.js` script
- No UI or functionality changes have been made
- All optimizations are applied without modifying the original design

## Performance Monitoring

To monitor the performance improvements:

1. Use browser developer tools (Lighthouse) to measure performance before and after optimizations
2. Check for Core Web Vitals improvements in Google Search Console
3. Monitor page load times and user experience metrics

## Additional Recommendations

For further performance improvements:

1. Consider using a CDN for static assets
2. Implement server-side caching with appropriate cache headers
3. Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 on your web server
4. Consider using a service worker for offline capabilities
