# Website Optimization Summary

This document outlines the optimizations made to the White Wings Visa Consultancy website to improve performance, reduce redundancy, and maintain full functionality.

## 1. JavaScript Optimizations

  - `direct-marquee-fix.js`
  - `simple-marquee-fix.js`
  - `inline-marquee.js`
  - `simple-mobile-menu.js`
  - `enable-scroll.js`
  - `simple-performance-boost.js`
  - `clear-cache.js`
  - `font-blocker.js`
  - `performance-monitor.js`
  - `mobile-scroll-fix.js`
  - `new-mobile-navbar.js`

### Script Replacements

- Removed redundant inline scripts from HTML files

### Functionality Preserved
All functionality has been preserved, including:
- Marquee animations
- Mobile menu functionality
- Scroll optimizations

- Form validations
