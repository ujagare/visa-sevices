   - Added `backface-visibility: hidden` to reduce rendering complexity

2. **Touch Interaction Improvements**
   - Implemented passive event listeners for touch events
   - Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for native-like inertia
   - Optimized touch multiplier values for better control

3. **Animation Performance**
   - Reduced animation complexity on mobile devices
   - Extended animation duration for marquee elements to reduce CPU usage
   - Applied content visibility optimizations for images

4. **Scroll Behavior**
   - Added scroll snapping for horizontal scrolling elements
   - Implemented smooth scrolling with proper momentum
   - Optimized scroll event handling with requestAnimationFrame

## Testing

The scrolling improvements have been tested on:
- Android devices (various versions)
- iOS devices (iPhone and iPad)
- Different mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

## Additional Notes

- No UI or functionality changes were made, only performance optimizations
- All optimizations are applied conditionally only on mobile devices
- Desktop experience remains unchanged
